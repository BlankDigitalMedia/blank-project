# blank Design Starter

A comprehensive, interactive component showcase and design system starter for Next.js projects optimized for AI-assisted development workflows, part of the blank project.

![Component Registry Preview](https://blank-project-gamma.vercel.app/)

## What Is This?

The blank Design Starter is a specialized Next.js template designed to accelerate UI development with a focus on AI-assisted workflows. Unlike typical component libraries or design systems, this project provides:

1. **Live Component Registry** - An interactive showcase of all shadcn/ui components with real-time theme reflection
2. **AI-Optimized Structure** - Organized specifically for effective interaction with AI coding assistants like Cursor
3. **Practical Implementation Path** - Direct bridge between choosing themes on shadcn/ui's themes page and implementing them
4. **Development-Time Resource** - Serves as both documentation and playground during development

This project is specifically designed to complement the [shadcn/ui themes page](https://ui.shadcn.com/themes), providing a working environment where those themes can be directly applied and tested.

## Technical Details

### Core Technologies

- **Next.js 15+** - React framework with App Router
- **React 18** - UI library
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe JavaScript
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **shadcn/ui** - Component collection built on Radix UI
- **Radix UI** - Headless UI primitives
- **Sonner** - Toast notifications
- **Lucide React** - Icon library

### Key Features

1. **Component Registry** (`/registry` route) - Organized by category:
   - Styles (colors, typography, UI styling)
   - Layout components
   - Forms & inputs
   - Feedback components
   - Navigation components
   - Data display components
   - Overlays
   - Date & time components

2. **Theme System**:
   - Light/dark mode toggle
   - System preference detection
   - CSS variables for all theme values
   - Real-time theme preview controls (Primary Color, Border Radius)
   - Shadcn/ui Theme Importer for easy configuration transfer

3. **AI-Assisted Customization**:
   - Instructions for modifying with AI tools
   - Clear file structure for AI context
   - Component examples optimized for prompting

4. **Performance**:
   - Dynamic imports for registry example components
   - Production build script (`build:prod`) to exclude registry

## How to Use This Project

### For Development

1. **Explore Components**: Browse the Registry (`/registry`) to see available components and how they look with current theme settings.
2. **Customize Theme**: 
    - Use the Theme Customizer controls for live preview adjustments.
    - Use the Theme Importer: Copy JSON theme config from [shadcn/ui themes](https://ui.shadcn.com/themes), paste it into the importer, process it, and copy the generated Tailwind snippet.
3. **Apply Theme**: Paste the generated snippet into your `tailwind.config.mjs` file to persist changes.
4. **Modify with AI**: Use AI assistants (like Cursor) to further customize theme variables in `tailwind.config.mjs` or request component usage examples.
5. **Build Your App**: Use the components and themes to build your actual application pages.

### For Production

Before deploying to production, use the `build:prod` script to automatically exclude registry components:
  ```bash
  npm run build:prod
  ```
- This uses environment variables and Next.js redirects to prevent the registry pages from being included in the production build, reducing bundle size.

## Design Decisions & Rationale

This project makes several intentional design decisions based on KISS principles:

1. **Registry as Development Resource**: The registry exists primarily as a development-time tool.
2. **Live Theme Preview & Import**: Provides immediate visual feedback and a simple way to integrate shadcn/ui themes.
3. **AI-Assisted Workflow**: Optimized structure and documentation for AI tools.
4. **shadcn/ui Foundation**: Builds upon shadcn/ui rather than reinventing components.
5. **Simplicity**: Avoids unnecessary abstractions or complexity.

## Working with AI Assistants

This project is specifically designed to work well with AI coding assistants. When using tools like Cursor:

1. **Theme Customization**: Ask the AI to help modify theme variables in `tailwind.config.mjs` based on visual preferences or the output from the Theme Importer.
2. **Component Usage**: Request code examples for specific components, using the registry as reference.
3. **Layout Creation**: Ask for assistance in building page layouts using the available components.
4. **Troubleshooting**: Share both the component registry view and your implementation code for context when debugging.
